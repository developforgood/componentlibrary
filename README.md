# DFG Component Library

Develop for Good Component Library made for every volunteer in DFG.

## How to open/run storybook

!! You need a github account to access this library.

1. Click the green "Code" button
2. Copy the link that stars with https with the copy button right next to it
3. Open terminal
4. Type in " git clone "the link that you copied" "
5. Type in "cd componentlibrary"
7. Type in 'npm run storybook'

And now the storybook will run on your local server!
The browser will automatically open a new window with the component library. 
If not, check terminal for exact address. 
Most likely http://localhost:6006/

## How to use

If you're a developer wanting to use the components displayed on the library, you should clone this repostory and use the actual source code. Storybook does NOT save your settings/changes that you have created while runnnig the storybook. 


<!-- ## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\ 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
