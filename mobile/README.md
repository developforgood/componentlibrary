# DFG Mobile Navigation Components

Consists of the Button which is nearly identical in design and functionality to web equivalent, except for differences in web and mobile in sizing in React Native and general mobile limitations.

Also contains the Bottom Tab Bar which most often functions as a navigator or menu. It is flexible in tab numbers, icons displayed in tabs, as well as having badges and different selected states.  (Note that for icons, a seperate icon library will be needed)
